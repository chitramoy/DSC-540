    "###  Relationship between 3 data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "US Census Data(acs2017_county_data.csv) and the List of US States table can be linked by geographic location ans state name. We could use the Google Maps API to determine the latitude and longitude for each state in the List of US States table, and then use this information to link the state data to the demographic and economic data in the US Census Data dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation and operations on dataset to accomplish future milestones\n",
    "\n",
    "        Based on the state name and it's geographic information, we can merge this 3 datasets after removing the headers from    those. After the first step will remove the unwanted columns from the datasets andf then merge those three into one dataset and that dataset could be used to inform policy makers and economic developers about the factors that contribute to population growth. It could also be used to identify states that are at risk of population decline, and to develop targeted interventions to promote population growth in these states.\n",
    "\n",
    "        As a data wrangling project using these datasets would be to create a dataset that maps the demographics and economic factors of each US state to the state's population growth rate. This could be done by linking the US Census Data dataset and the List of US States table, as described above. Once the datasets are linked, we could use statistical analysis to calculate the population growth rate for each state, and then identify correlations between the population growth rate and demographic and economic factors, such as median income, poverty rate, and education levels.\n",

    "Ethical implications of using US Census Data for a data wrangling project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy: The US Census Data contains personal information about individuals and households. It is important to take steps to protect the privacy of this data, such as anonymizing the data or using differential privacy techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias: The US Census Data may be biased in certain ways. For example, it may be more difficult to reach certain populations, such as low-income households or immigrant communities. It is important to be aware of these potential biases and to take steps to mitigate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrimination: The US Census Data could be used to discriminate against certain groups of people. For example, it could be used to target certain groups with marketing messages or to deny them access to services or opportunities. It is important to use the data in a responsible and ethical way to avoid discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use differential privacy techniques: Differential privacy is a set of techniques that can be used to protect the privacy of individuals in a dataset while still allowing for accurate analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some of the challenges that you might face in a US Census Data project include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data quality: The US Census Data is a large and complex dataset. It is important to carefully clean and prepare the data before using it for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data complexity: The US Census Data contains a wide range of variables. It is important to understand the meaning of the variables and how they can be used for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical considerations: As discussed above, there are a number of ethical considerations that must be taken into account when using US Census Data. It is important to design your project in a way that respects the privacy of the data and avoids bias and discrimination.\n",
